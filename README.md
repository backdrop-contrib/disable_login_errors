Disable login errors
====================

Prevent the display of all login error messages. A user attempting to login will
not be aware if the account exists, an invalid user name or password has been
submitted, or if the account is blocked. Two of the messages which are hidden 
are _Sorry, unrecognized username_ and _Sorry, incorrect password_.
