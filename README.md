Disable login errors
====================

Prevent the display of all login error messages. A user attempting to login will
not be aware if the account exists, an invalid user name or password has been
submitted, or if the account is blocked. The core messages "Sorry, unrecognized
username or password. Have you forgotten your password?" and "The username
{username} has not been activated or is blocked." are also hidden.
